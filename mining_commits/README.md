# Extracting commits data from GitHub using GitHub Commits API 

 - Add your GitHub username and token in the beginning of the file 'fetchScript.sh'.
 - Modify the list of repositories in the file 'apiLinks' (depending on the repositories of interest).
 - Run 'bash loop_theFetchScript.sh' to fetch data from all specified repositories.
 - As a result a csv file with the name of each commit's author and the date of the commit would be created.
