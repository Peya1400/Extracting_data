# Extracting issues data from GitHub using GitHub Issues API 

 - Add your GitHub username and token in the beginning of the file *fetchScript_issues_all.sh*.
 - Modify the list of repositories in the file *apiLinks_issues* (depending on the repositories of interest).
 - Run *bash loop_theFetchScript_issues.sh* to fetch data from all specified repositories.
 - As a result a csv file with the id, state (open/closed) and the creation date of all issues would be created.
